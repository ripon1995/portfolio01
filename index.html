            <p>The course has been created with a lot of thought and planning. Each topic related to the one before. Rob not only teaches he shows on this course how to google the information needed, which I've been doing and I've learnt a lot from this method of teaching. I've nearly finished the course and I feel very confident to send my CV to potential empolyers. Thanks for an excellent course.</p>
